# Machine Leanning Nanodegree



This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. 
##### 1- Machine learning techniques and algorithms.
##### 2-How to package and deploy your models to a production environment.
##### 3-Practical experience using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application.
##### 4-Evaluate the Models Performance.
##### 5-How to Update the Models As You Gather More Data.


There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, but they are available here as well.

## Core Curriculum:

#### 1- Welcome to the Nanodegree program
- **Summary:** Neural networks is the Bedrock to Deep learning . we'll learn how it works and test our ability by Building Neural Network from Sctratch.
- **Keywords:** Logistic Regression ,Multilayer Perceptrons , Gradient Descent , Backpropagation.

#### 2- Software Engineering Fundamentals 
- **Summary:** Convolutional neural networks is the standrad for solving Computer Vision Problems. it's used in Self-Driving cars ,face recognation and Medical imaging . we'll learn how to build and train ConvNet using TensorFlow and using regularization technique like TensorFlow Dropout for reducing overfitting and apply that to image classification Problem.  
- **Keywords:** ConvNet,Tensorflow , Tensorflow Dropout , K Fold Cross Validation , Deep Neural Networks.

#### 3- Machine Learning in Production
- **Summary:** Recurrent Neural Networks are able to learn from sequences of data . RNNs also work great as feature extractors for text which you can use for things like sentiment analysis. Youâ€™ll use recurrent networks to generate new text and translate from one language to another. In this section we'll learn the concept behind RNNs and a brief introduction to reinforcement learning to train an AI agent by giving it rewards for performing correct actions.  
- **Keywords:** RNNs,Hyperparameters,Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Word Embeddings, Word2Vec,TensorBoard.

#### 4- Machine Learning, Case Studies
- **Summary:** Generative adversarial networks (GANS) pit two neural networks in competition, allowing these networks to model reality with amazing accuracy. Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, will show you how these fascinating models work and how to build them.
- **Keywords:** GANs.

#### 5- Build Your Own Machine Learning Portfolio Project
- **Summary:** Generative adversarial networks (GANS) pit two neural networks in competition, allowing these networks to model reality with amazing accuracy. Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, will show you how these fascinating models work and how to build them.
- **Keywords:** GANs.
